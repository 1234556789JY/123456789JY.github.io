	<h1>Big data</h1>
	<p>In these days, the world relies on data for many things. In any traditional way, data has always been very large and complex, from social media interactions to online transactions, from sensor readings to medical records, the amount of data used every day is staggering. All sorts of massive amounts of information rely on “big data”. Big data isn't just used in social media or healthcare, it's used in a much wider variety of business areas. But what is 'Big Data'?</p>
	<p>“Big Data” is information assets that require new processing models to enable greater decision-making, insight discovery, and adaptability to high growth rates and diversity. It is considered the art of accessing and storing large amounts of data. The meaning of “big data” is not to master huge amounts of data and information, but to specialize the processing and distribution of these meaningful data.</p>
	<p>In today's technological development, many companies also use “big data”, the use of big data allows many companies to complete a leap in the e-commerce platform. Amazon, a well-known multinational technology company, is engaged in many industries, e-commerce, artificial intelligence and cloud computing. As the largest e-commerce platform, Amazon is bound to use big data, and the big data technology they use is leading the industry. Where do they use “Big Data”? Amazon uses technology to intelligently stock, ship, and distribute goods. When a customer places an order, the goods will be shipped efficiently and picked before shipping, which greatly reduces Amazon's manual labor and improves efficiency. And when the commodity inventory emergency, “big data” can timely and effective reminder of which goods need to be replenished. These are the benefits of “big data”, but also let Amazon in the sale of goods more easily and efficiently. Moreover, the Amazon e-commerce platform can also conduct data analysis, according to the most popular products of competing companies to analyze, so that their own companies faster and easier to understand the customer information and product information of competing companies, which improves the ability to analyze data.</p>
	<p>In addition to Amazon, the healthcare industry is now using “big data”. “Big data” can detect human error or equipment failure in time, and can avoid many fatal errors, which is very important in the medical industry. The analysis of “big data” can also promote the importance of doctors' health and treatment of patients, can be more directly and accurately analyze the patients, improve efficiency and reduce many unnecessary costs. Rationalize the allocation of medical resources and enhance the planning and management of healthcare facility resources. Without “Big Data”, people could not recognize their illnesses in time, thus missing the best time for treatment. Now, “Big Data” can be utilized to help identify diseases in time and provide effective treatments to improve the survival rate. It is also playing an increasingly important role in predictive analytics and detecting the effects of treatment.</p>
	<p>Through these two examples, we can see that “Big Data” will become more and more important in the future. More industries will introduce Big Data and improve efficiency and productivity across the board.” Big Data is also an indispensable technology for the future, and people are relying on it more and more. It will play an important role in every industry, easing the work of workers.</p>
	<p>That's why I chose “Big Data”, I think “Big Data” is a part of life that we can't live without, and it can provide us with convenience and make our lives easier. It has the potential to transform industries, drive innovation and improve the quality of life for people across the globe in the future.</p>
